# Project Structure

Once you download the starter code for the ðŸš§ project you will see some files
we have here

- [ ]  ðŸ“„**main.dart** - that's is the start of the app
- [ ]  ðŸ“„**data.dart** - which holds all their data in there
we have four different models in the app.
    - [ ]  ðŸ“„ **food.dart** which has an image URL a name and a price and the image URL links to one of the images in the assets folder.
    - [ ]  ðŸ“„**order.dart** consist of a restaurant , food and quantity
    - [ ]  ðŸ“„ **restaurant.dart**  which contains an image URL name address reading and list of food
    items which represents the menu
    - [ ]  ðŸ“„ **user.dart** class which consists of a name a list of orders and a list of orders that are in the cart

back in **data.dart**  are we can see how we instantiate data.

First we create all the different types of food each with our own image name and price.
Next we create all the restaurants each with their own image URL name address reading and their own menu from the food items we instantiated above and now below this.

The last thing to note is how we imported the images into our app. If we go into a **pubspec.yaml** file we can see that if we scroll down to assets all I did was uncomment.

This images line and then replace it with assets / images and that's how we import all of our images from our assets images directory.
